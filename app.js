   One page, no routes: the sections are all in the document and a data-view on
   <body> says which one is up. The stylesheet does the rest — it is what moves
   the name, fades the section in and marks the menu — so nothing here touches
   a style, only the one attribute everything else reads.

   The name is the way back. It is disabled at home, which keeps it out of the
   tab order as well as out of reach: a heading that is only sometimes a
   control has to say which it is at the time. */
